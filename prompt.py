    Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.
    You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

    Then you will output the content of each file including ALL code.
    Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that
    FILENAME is the file name including the file extension and path from the root of the project. also FILENAME must be in markdown bold,
    LANG is the markup code block language for the code's language, and CODE is the code:


    **FILENAME**
    ```LANG
    CODE
    ```

    Do not comment on what every file does

    You will start with the entrypoint file which will must be called "index.js", then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.
    Please note that the code should be fully functional. No placeholders.
    This will be a react.js project so you must create a webpack.config.js at the root of the project that uses "index.js" as the entry file
    The output in the webpack.config.js must point to a bundle.js file that's in the same folder as the index.html
    Place all of the public assets in a folder named "public" in lowercase with an index.html file that is linked to the bundle specified in the webpack.config.js
    You must include a package.json file in the root of the folder that resolves all the required dependencies for this react.js project. All of the dependencies and devDependencies must be set to a "*" value. Also, for every package.json you must at least include the packages @babel/core, babel-loader, react and react-dom
    The package.json must be valid JSON
    You must include a .babelrc file in the root folder that has @babel/preset-react set

    Follow a language and framework appropriate best practice file naming convention.
    Make sure that files contain all imports. Make sure that the code in different files are compatible with each other.
